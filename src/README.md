## Introduction
### Objectives
The goal of this assignment was to create a DNS client that could send out Datagram packets according to the UDP protocol and read through the corresponding response packet. This client had to be able to

## Experiment
1. What are the IP addresses of McGillâ€™s DNS servers? Use the Google public DNS server (8.8.8.8) to perform a NS query for mcgill.ca and any subsequent follow-up queries that may be required. What response do you get? Does this match what you expected?

2. Use your client to run DNS queries for 5 different website addresses, of your choice, in addition to www.google.com and www.facebook.com, for a total of seven addresses. Query the seven addresses using both a McGill DNS server (132.206.85.18) and the Google public DNS server (8.8.8.8).

3. Do the responses from both servers match? If not, how do they differ? Speculate on why they might differ, and propose additional experiments you could conduct to further explore your hypothesis.
